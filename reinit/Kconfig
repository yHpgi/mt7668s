	  Enable support for reinitializing the MT7668S WiFi module
	  in the Amlogic vendor kernel. This is particularly useful
	  for systems that require the WiFi module to be reset without
	  a full system reboot, such as in cases of WiFi module failure
	  or dynamic reconfiguration.

	  This option is dependent on the presence of the Amlogic driver,
	  ensuring that the necessary infrastructure is available for
	  reinitialization.

	  To compile this support as a loadable kernel module, choose 'M'
	  here. This will create a module named 'mt7668s_reinit.ko'.

	  Select 'y' to enable reinitialization support, ensuring
	  more robust WiFi operation in dynamic or fault-prone environments.
	  Select 'n' to disable this feature if it is not needed.

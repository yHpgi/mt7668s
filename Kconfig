	  Enable support for the Mediatek MT7668S SDIO WiFi chipset.
	  This driver provides the necessary functionality to operate
	  the MT7668S chipset via SDIO interface.

	  To compile this driver as a loadable kernel module, choose 'M'
	  here. This will create a module named 'mt7668s.ko'.

	default n
	help
	  Enable this option to pre-allocate memory for MT7668S WiFi
	  operations. Pre-allocating memory can improve performance
	  by reducing dynamic memory allocation overhead during runtime.
	  This is useful in memory-constrained environments or for
	  improving latency.

	depends on PINCTRL_MESON_G12A
	help
	  Enable this option to apply a workaround specific to the
	  Meson G12A platform. Due to buffer length constraints on
	  G12A, this workaround reduces the overall buffer length
	  to prevent issues with WiFi operation.

	  Select 'y' to enable the workaround, ensuring stable
	  performance on the Meson G12A platform. Select 'n' to
	  disable the workaround if it is not needed.
